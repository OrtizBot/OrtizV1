# OrtizBot V1

## Pilot Schools

The selection of pilot schools for the OrtizBot V1 project will be based on a 10-point system, taking into account the following categories:

### 1. Age of Students

The age range of students in a school is a key factor in ensuring that the OrtizBot V1 is suitable for the intended audience.

- 0 points: Primarily elementary school students (up to 5th grade).
- 3 points: Middle school students (6th to 8th grade).
- 5 points: High school students (9th to 12th grade).

### 2. Location (Distance from the Project Office)

Proximity to the project office is considered for logistical efficiency and support.

- 0 points: Within 5 kilometers of the project office.
- 2 points: 5 to 10 kilometers.
- 5 points: Beyond 10 kilometers.

### 3. Interest in Technology

The level of interest in technology showcases the school's enthusiasm for embracing innovative projects.

- 0 points: Low interest or no previous involvement in tech-related activities.
- 3 points: Moderate interest with occasional engagement in technology initiatives.
- 5 points: High interest, actively participating in technology-related programs.

### 4. Budget

The available budget for educational projects is a critical aspect to determine feasibility.

- 0 points: Limited budget with minimal allocation for extracurricular activities.
- 3 points: Moderate budget with some flexibility for innovative programs.
- 5 points: Substantial budget specifically earmarked for technology and robotics initiatives.

### 5. 3D Printing Abilities

The possession of a 3D printer enhances the school's capability to actively participate in the assembly and customization of OrtizBot components.

- 0 points: No 3D printing capabilities.
- 3 points: Limited 3D printing capabilities.
- 5 points: Full 3D printing capabilities with the ability to fabricate complex parts.

Schools will be selected based on their total points. As the project progresses, it will be opened more broadly, and a calendar with specific release dates for broader access will be added later. This ensures a phased approach to the OrtizBot V1 project, allowing for wider participation over time.
